# Matrix

Hole **Matrix** class and it's relative classes are placed into the namespace matrix.
In the following samples, I'll suppose you've included **matrix.h** to your code and added the following line to your code:
```cpp
using namespace matrix;
```

### Creating an instance of Matrix

Matrix can be created in one of the following ways:
```cpp
// creates empty Matrix
Matrix default_matrix(); 
// creates Matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns filled with zeros
Matrix zero_matrix(2, 3); 
// creates Matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns filled with random values in between of lower_bound and upper_bound
// if lower_bound and upper_bound are omitted, then values will be generated in the interval [0;1]
Matrix random_matrix(2, 3, true, lower_bound, upper_bound);
```

There are also special square matrices, which can be created using static function-members of **Matrix** class:
```cpp
Matrix zeros = Matrix::zeros(5); // creates zero matrix of order 5
Matrix ones = Matrix::ones(5); // creates matrix of order 5 filled with ones
Matrix identity = Matrix::identity(5); // creates identity matrix of order 5
```

### Matrix operations

Here's samples of common matrix operations (shorthand assignment versions are also available):
```cpp
matrix + 5; // adds 5 to the matrix
matrix + another_matrix; // adds two matrices

matrix - 5; // subtracts 5 from the matrix
matrix - another_matrix; // subtracts another_matrix from matrix

matrix * 5; // multiplies matrix by 5
matrix * another_matrix; // multiplies matrix by another_matrix

matrix / 5; // divides matrix by 5
```

Other matrix operations can be performed using member-functions:
```cpp
matrix.hadm_product(another_matrix); // returns Hadamard product of two matrices
matrix.transpose(); // return transposed matrix
matrix.map(map_function); // applies map_function to every element of the matrix
```

Comparison operators are deleted for Matrix.
